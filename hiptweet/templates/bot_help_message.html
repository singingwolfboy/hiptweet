Hi! I'm HipTweet, a friendly bot who can tweet for you!
<br>
{% if screen_name %}
  To tweet, just send a HipChat message that starts with <code>/tweet</code>,
  and I'll tweet everything after that. For example, if you type
  <code>/tweet Lunch was great today!</code>, I'll tweet
  <code>Lunch was great today!</code>
  <br>
  Right now, I'm tweeting to the
  <a href="https://twitter.com/{{screen_name}}">@{{screen_name}}</a>
  account on Twitter.
{% else %}
  Unfortunately, I haven't been connected to Twitter yet, so I can't do
  much at the moment. Tell your HipChat administrator to hook me up,
  so I can tweet for you!
